# Train-Scheduler

This is a Train Scheduler. 

This app allows users type type in the name of a train, the train's destination, how often it comes, and the first time it comes. The app will calculate the time of the next arrival and how many minutes away the next train is. The app stores all of the user's information in Firebase and appends that information to the screen so that users can see what trains they have already generated.

The biggest challenge creating this app was utilizing moment.js. After reading through the documentation and getting some assistance, I was able to figure out how to get the time to accurately parse on the screen.
